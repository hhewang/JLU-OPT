# JLU-OPT
Provide a small portion of the surface defect detection dataset for planar optical components (made of flexible materials), which includes a small portion of the six surface defects in planar optical components, including scratches, cracks, edge fractures, stripes, stains, and pits. As this dataset is self-made according to project requirements, it is for reference only, and the complete dataset is not yet fully provided due to confidentiality reasons.
