# JLU-OPT
Provide a small dataset for surface defect detection of planar optical components (made of flexible materials), which includes a small portion of the six types of surface defects in planar optical components, including scratches, cracks, edge ruputures, striations, stains, and pits. Due to project requirements, this dataset is a self-made dataset for reference only and has certain limitations. The complete dataset has not been fully provided yet due to confidentiality reasons.
